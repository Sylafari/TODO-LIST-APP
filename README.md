ToDo-List-App
Quinn Cheng

A ToDo App using React Router for navigation and Redux for state management.

This webpage is very simple to use and has a horizontal navigation bar leading to three pages. The three pages are About, Todo, and Contact. 

The Horizontal Navigation Bar is created and implemented with React Router so one can move from page to page without the website reloading.

The two interactive pages are the Todo and Contact pages.

The Todo page is where the Todo List App is and is built using React Redux to hold the state of the contents within.

The Contact page is where a form that uses React to store the text fields into a state.

The technologies used for this project was .html, React, Redux, React Router, and Materialize CSS. The reason for Materialize CSS was for its easy implemenation of the color and look of the horizontal navigation bar.

Ideas for Future Improvement
1. More advanced CSS usage and styling the buttons to make them look better.
2. Figuring out how to delete the items in the Todo List, I tried but couldn't figure out a way that worked with the onClick properly.
3. Figure out a way to trim down the amount of code needed for the form in Contact.js
